/**
 * Game loop function.
 *
 * The game loop is responsible for overseeing the main game logic.
 * It doesn't handle any game logic or change any of the game's state,
 * but it is responsible for calling the parts of the code that do.
 *
 * The game has an internal primary state, and based on that state
 * we hook onto a 'handler' and then call the handler's functions.
 * Each handler has several predetermined external functions:
 *
 *    - init()      - Ensures that it has all resources loaded to work.
 *    - update()    - Updates the internal state based on user input and logic.
 *    - render()    - Renders its output to a bitmap buffer.
 *    - will_exit() - Returns true if we must stop this handler.
 *    - exit()      - Shuts down the handler and unloads resources.
 *
 * Each handler has only these functions externally callable.
 *
 * To begin with, we check what the current game state is.
 * Based on the state, we'll set five function pointers to the functions
 * provided by the appropriate handler. So if the user has just started
 * a level, we would set the function pointers to 'level_init', etc.
 *
 * This takes place in the outer loop. Once the handler is set, we call
 * its init() function and enter the inner loop, which executes once
 * per frame and calls the handler's update() and render() functions.
 *
 * When a handler is done (for example, if a user has completed a level,
 * and control of the game logic must be handed back to the 'menu' handler)
 * its will_exit() function will return true. At that point, the inner loop
 * is broken and we go back into the outer loop, where a new handler is chosen.
 *
 * When exiting the outer game loop, the game itself is shut down.
